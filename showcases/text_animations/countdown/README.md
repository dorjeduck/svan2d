# Countdown

Morphs between digits in a countdown sequence (e.g. 3 → 2 → 1 → GO) using vertex-based font morphing. Each transition smoothly reshapes one glyph into the next with color changes between steps.

## Run

```bash
python showcases/text_animations/countdown/main.py
```

## Config

Edit `config.toml` to change the starting number, finale text, font, colors, morph/hold ratio, and export settings.
