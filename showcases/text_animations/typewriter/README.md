# Typewriter

Characters appear one by one as if typed, with a blinking cursor that advances after each character. Supports multiple lines with configurable pauses between them and a final cursor blink at the end.

## Run

```bash
python showcases/text_animations/typewriter/main.py
```

## Config

Edit `config.toml` to change the text lines, font, typing speed, line pause duration, cursor style, and export settings.
