# Ulam Spiral — Step by Step (v1)

Alternative version of the step-by-step Ulam spiral using TextState for number labels instead of TextPathState. Squares appear one at a time with staggered scale animation and a camera zoom-out effect.

## Run

```bash
python showcases/primes/ulam_spiral/step_by_step_v1/main.py
```

## Config

Edit `config.py` to change the number of rings, labeled ring count, square size, colors, font path, and frame rate.
