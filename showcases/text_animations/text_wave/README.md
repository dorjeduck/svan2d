# Text Wave

Letters slide in from the right riding a sine wave, each staggered in time. The wave amplitude decays smoothly so the letters settle into a straight line. Optional rotation aligns each letter to the wave slope.

## Run

```bash
python showcases/text_animations/text_wave/main.py
```

## Config

Edit `config.toml` to change the text, font, wave amplitude, wavelength, speed, decay timing, and export settings.
