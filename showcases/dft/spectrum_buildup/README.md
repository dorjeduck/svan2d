# Spectrum Buildup

Shows how adding more Fourier coefficients sharpens a shape approximation. The animation progresses through stages (e.g. 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 12, 20, 40 coefficients), each drawing one full revolution. Early stages produce rough circles; later stages reveal the full shape.

## Run

```bash
python showcases/dft/spectrum_buildup/main.py
```

## Config

Edit `config.toml` to change the shape, stages array, color gradient, and export settings.
