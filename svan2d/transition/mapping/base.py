"""Base classes for generic M竊誰 mapping

Provides a unified mapper interface that works on any positionable items:
- States (letters in word morphing)
- VertexLoops (holes within shapes)
- Any other type with a position

The key abstraction is Match, which represents what happens to each item:
- start=item, end=item: morphing between two items
- start=item, end=None: destruction (fade out)
- start=None, end=item: creation (fade in)

class Mapper(ABC):
    """Abstract base class for M竊誰 mapping strategies.

    Mappers determine how items are matched during M竊誰 transitions.
    Different strategies produce different visual effects:

    - SimpleMapper: No matching, all old items fade out, all new fade in
    - GreedyMapper: Match each item to its nearest neighbor
    - ClusteringMapper: Group nearby items together for balanced matching

    The mapper receives two lists of items and a position extractor function,
    and returns a list of Match objects describing how each item should transition.

    Example:
        # For states (letters)
        mapper.map(states1, states2, lambda s: s.pos)

        # For holes (vertex loops)
        mapper.map(holes1, holes2, lambda h: h.centroid())
