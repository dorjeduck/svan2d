# Game of Life — Pattern Showcase

Displays a gallery of well-known Game of Life patterns — oscillators, spaceships, methuselahs, and guns — each in its own scene. Scenes are connected with transitions (fade, wipe, slide, zoom, iris) and the grid auto-scales to fit each pattern.

## Run

```bash
python showcases/game_of_life/pattern/main.py
```

## Config

Edit `config.py` to enable/disable individual patterns, change scene dimensions, transition type, cell colors, and animation timing.
