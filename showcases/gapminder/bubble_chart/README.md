# Gapminder Bubble Chart

Hans Rosling-style animated bubble chart showing the relationship between GDP per capita, life expectancy, and population across countries over time. Bubbles are sized by population (sqrt-proportional) and colored by continent, with a log-scale GDP x-axis and linear life expectancy y-axis.

## Run

```bash
python showcases/gapminder/bubble_chart/main.py
```

## Config

Edit `config.toml` to change the number of countries, continent colors, bubble sizing, axis ranges, label styling, and export settings.
