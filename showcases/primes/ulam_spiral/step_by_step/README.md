# Ulam Spiral — Step by Step

Builds an Ulam spiral one number at a time with a staggered scale-in animation. Primes and composites are color-coded, the inner rings show numeric labels, and a smooth camera zoom-out keeps the growing spiral in view.

## Run

```bash
python showcases/primes/ulam_spiral/step_by_step/main.py
```

## Config

Edit `config.py` to change the number of rings, labeled ring count, square size, colors, font path, and frame rate.
