# Gapminder Trajectory Trails

Connected scatterplot showing how selected countries travel through GDP/life-expectancy space over time. Each country gets a progressively drawn trail path, a moving marker tracking the current position, and a following label.

## Run

```bash
python showcases/gapminder/trajectory_trails/main.py
```

## Config

Edit `config.toml` to change the selected countries (explicit list or top N by population), trail styling, axis ranges, and export settings.
