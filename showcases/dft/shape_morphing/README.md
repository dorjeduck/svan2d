# Shape Morphing

Smoothly transitions between shapes by interpolating their Fourier coefficients in the frequency domain. The animation cycles through a sequence of shapes (e.g. heart, star, circle, infinity), blending coefficients to produce organic in-between forms.

## Run

```bash
python showcases/dft/shape_morphing/main.py
```

## Config

Edit `config.toml` to change the shape sequence, number of coefficients, colors, and export settings.
