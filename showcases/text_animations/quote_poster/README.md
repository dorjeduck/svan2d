# Quote Poster

Generates an animated poster where quote characters scatter in from random positions, decorative circles and lines fade in, and the author name appears with a font morph from block to cursive.

## Run

```bash
python showcases/text_animations/quote_poster/main.py
```

## Config

Edit `config.toml` to change the quote text, author, fonts, scatter radius, decoration style, color palette, and export settings.
