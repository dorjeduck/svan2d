# Kinetic Typography

Per-character entrance animations for text, with multiple modes — scatter, rain, explode, and spiral. Each mode gets its own scene; scenes are connected by fade transitions to form a continuous sequence.

## Run

```bash
python showcases/text_animations/kinetic_typography/main.py
```

## Config

Edit `config.toml` to change the text, font, entrance modes, character stagger, scatter radius, color palette, and export settings.
