# Ulam Spiral — Sieve of Eratosthenes

Animates the Sieve of Eratosthenes on an Ulam spiral layout. Numbers appear ring by ring; each sieve step highlights the current prime, then marks its multiples as composite. A side panel tracks the active sieve prime, prime count, and step counter in real time.

## Run

```bash
python showcases/primes/ulam_spiral/sieve_of_eratosthenes/main.py
```

## Config

Edit `config.py` to change the number of rings, square size, gap, colors (candidate, prime, composite, sieve prime), and frame rate.
