# Game of Life — Classic

Simulates Conway's Game of Life on a grid. Cells animate their birth (scale up) and death (fade out) over configurable durations, producing a continuous, organic visualization of the cellular automaton.

## Run

```bash
python showcases/game_of_life/classic/main.py
```

## Config

Edit `config.py` to change grid size, generation count, birth/death animation durations, colors, initial pattern mode, and frame rate.
